# Custom Stars

A Minecraft mod which allows you to customise stars using various properties
which alter star count, colour, and more.

This was created as a Forge port of [Custom Stars [Fabric]](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/custom-stars),
though more features may be added in the future.
